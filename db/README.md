Status: July 2020

[Maarj_AM_](https://maarjam.botany.ut.ee) is a database containing Glomeromycota DNA sequence data that originate from ecological studies based on “environmental samples” or taxonomic investigations based on cultured fungi. Maarj_AM_ database is provided as FASTA file and formatted to BLAST+ database. Sequence headers are formated following the notaion used by the NCBI:
```
>gi|MAARJAM_CODE|gb|ACCESSION_CODE| Family Genus Species MaarjAM_VT_TAXON
```
Sequences are trimmed to contain SSU amplicon gene region between primer pairs of NS31 and AML2. Contains 3081 sequences and 384 VT. Reference sequences are dereplicated.
